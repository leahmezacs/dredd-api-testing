## Step 1: Git
> Open up your terminal to a desired directory for this project. 

Enter the following command, replacing leah with your name:

`mkdir leah-api-testing` [this creates a directory]

`git --version` [if it returns nothing, you need to install git]

- If you dont have git installed:
  - [download git instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

  - `git clone https://github.com/leahmezacs/dredd-api-testing.git` [the readme.md will now download to your directory]

`node -v` [if it returns nothing, you need to install node - see below]

`npm -v` [if it returns nothing, you need to install npm - see below]
